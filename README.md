# StatusScreen
Allows to display graphic status pages and browse them with rotary encoder.

I developped this library to run it on a Teensy 3.2 ARM board but if should be compatible with Arduino.
The display I use is a OLED SSD 1322 (256x64 pixels) with grey shade, but you can change that and take advantage of all the displays supported by U8Glib.

This library use U8Glib.h and ClickEncoder.h in order to work, they are included in a separate ZIP file.
